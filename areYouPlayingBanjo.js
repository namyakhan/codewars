//CHALLENGE‚ùì
Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:

name + " plays banjo" 
name + " does not play banjo"
Names given are always valid strings.

function areYouPlayingBanjo(name) {

 let firstChar = name.charAt(0) 
  
  if(firstChar === 'r' || firstChar === 'R'){
    return `${name} plays banjo`
  } else{
     return `${name} does not play banjo`
  }
 
}
